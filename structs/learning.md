# Learnings about structs, types and Interfaces

### types
- We use types to **encapsulate** logic together, best example is, area, perimeter etc of different shapes.
- There is different formulae for different shape in order to calculate these properties.
- So, in order to make a bunch of functions, why not make something that is self containing ? want to calculate area of a triangle ? use triangle.area() and similarly for rectangle, use rectangle.area()
- That is where types come in, you can attach methods to them.
